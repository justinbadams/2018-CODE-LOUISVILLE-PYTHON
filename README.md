# 2018-CODE-LOUISVILLE-PYTHON
Course Project

This project was completed using Anaconda Jupyter Python. Just Click on the IT_WORKS_DO_NOT_DELETE_OR_ADJUST.ipynb file to run the data.

The project was done to determine sales volume for each product within our catalog. Each product has a Style, Size and Pattern and we would like to total each to give us an analysis of what is selling and what is not. 

The raw data is located in the website_data.csv file and was loaded into a pandas dataframe to be converted into a sqlite3 database, website.db. The data was manipulated to display the amount sold of each product and that info was entered into a bar chart for furhter visual analysis.
